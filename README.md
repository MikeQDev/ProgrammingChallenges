ProgrammingChallenges
=====================

Programs I created that were assignments in the first Java book I read.

GUI programs are located in the higher chapter folders.

All of these projects were created in NetBeans, so that is why the file structure may be a bit confusing. Nonetheless, all programs still compile and run.
